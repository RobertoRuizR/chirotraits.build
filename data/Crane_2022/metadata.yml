    for the name; https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004881/
  taxonomic_resolution: species

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Eptesicus serotinus
  replace: Cnephaeus serotinus
  reason: previously included E. pachyomus and E. isabellinus; may include E. kobayashii,
    but the species is tentatively retained here; the species also includes the recently
    described lobatus, which was described for populations from Ukraine to the Caucasus;
    these populations likely represent either the taxon turcomanus or mirza, which
    may be distinct species in their own right (either two distinct species, or a
    single species including both names); the taxonomic status of the eastern portion
    of the distribution of E. serotinus has yet to be determined; moved from Eptesicus
    to Cnephaeus https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005531/

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Hipposideros pratti
  replace: Hipposideros swinhoii
  reason: previously known under the name H. pratti, but the name swinhoii was shown
    to be the appropriate name for the species; the name swinhoii was previously considered
    a synonym of H. armiger; often spelt 'swinhoei', but the name was originally spelt
    'swinhoii' and 'swinhoei' is an unjustified emendation (not appearing to be in
    prevailing use), so the spelling has been changed to match the original description
    https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004637/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Hipposideros vittatus
  replace: Macronycteris vittata
  reason: Synonym of Macronycteris vittata https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004644/

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Lophostoma silvicolum
  replace: Lophostoma silvicola
  reason: previously included L. occidentale; specific epithet has variously been
    spelt 'silvicola' and 'silvicolum', but 'silvicola' is the correct spelling as
    it the original spelling and is a noun in apposition https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004978/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Megaderma lyra
  replace: Lyroderma lyra
  reason: previously included L. sinense; moved from Megaderma to Lyroderma so that
    Megaderma is not paraphyletic https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004648/
  taxonomic_resolution: species

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Neoromicia nana
  replace: Afronycteris nanus
  reason: moved from Neoromicia to the recently described Afronycteris; the specific
    epithet has been suggested to be spelt 'nana' to match the generic gender, but
    'nanus' is a noun, and does not change with the genus https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005700/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Neoromicia rendalli
  replace: Pseudoromicia rendalli
  reason: moved from Neoromicia to the recently described Psuedoromicia https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005774/

  reason: Subspecies of Pteronotus quadridens https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004866/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Pteropus giganteus
  replace: Pteropus vampyrus
  reason: includes the name giganteus (that species is now known as P. medius); P.
    intermedius has been included under this species or under P. medius, but the species
    is tentatively recognized as distinct here until further research is done https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004507/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Rhinolophus indorouxii
  replace: Rhinolophus rouxii
  reason: includes the recently described indorouxii; indorouxii likely represents
    a distinct species, although this needs to be proven with morphological and genetic
    data rather than just echolocation data; a new valid name would also need to be
    described for the indorouxii taxon since the paper that first used indorouxii
    did not include a full description, holotype, and type locality designation https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004735/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Rhinolophus paradoxolophus

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Tadarida aegyptiaca
  replace: Nyctinomus aegyptiacus
  reason: tentatively moved from Tadarida to Nyctinomus, but a more thorough revision
    of Tadarida is needed as the genus as currently defined is polyphyletic; the name
    thomasi may represent a distinct species, but is retained under T. aegyptiaca
    here https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005261/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Vampyriscus nymphaea
  replace: Vampyriscus nymphaeus
  reason: the specific epithet 'nymphaea/us' is treated as an adjective based on the
    Greek root rather than a Latin noun here; moved from Vampyressa to Vampyriscus
