  reason: previously known under the name H. pratti, but the name swinhoii was shown
    to be the appropriate name for the species; the name swinhoii was previously considered
    a synonym of H. armiger; often spelt 'swinhoei', but the name was originally spelt
    'swinhoii' and 'swinhoei' is an unjustified emendation (not appearing to be in
    prevailing use), so the spelling has been changed to match the original description

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Lophostoma occidentalis
  replace: Lophostoma occidentale
  reason: split from L. silvicolum and includes the recently described aequatorialis;

    for gender agreement https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004976/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Lophostoma silvicolum
  replace: Lophostoma silvicola

- find: Myotis hajastanicus
  replace: Myotis davidii
  reason: includes aurascens and hajastanicus and has been considered to included
    M. nipalensis, but this species was recently recognized as distinct; aurascens
    and davidii are tentatively considered synonyms here, although some recent authors
    have suggested that this arrangement is premature; given the the uncertainty surrounding
    the taxonomy of this group, aurascens and davidii are still considered conspecific
    here following the trends in recent literature, although further research is certainly
    needed https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005396/

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Paratriaenops furculus
  replace: Paratriaenops furcula
  reason: generally spelt furculus, but the name has been changed to furcula because
    it is a noun in apposition and does not change with generic gender; moved from
    Triaenops to Paratriaenops; moved from Hipposideridae to Rhinonycteridae https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004763/

- find: Pteropus giganteus
  replace: Pteropus vampyrus
  reason: includes the name giganteus (that species is now known as P. medius); P.
    intermedius has been included under this species or under P. medius, but the species
    is tentatively recognized as distinct here until further research is done https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004507/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Pteropus gilliardorum
  replace: Pteropus gilliardi
  reason: the name 'gilliardorum' is often used for this species, but this is considered

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Pteropus leucopterus
  replace: Desmalopex leucoptera
  reason: usually spelt 'leucopterus', but the name is an adjective and Desmalopex

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Rhinolophus indorouxii
  replace: Rhinolophus rouxii
  reason: includes the recently described indorouxii; indorouxii likely represents
    a distinct species, although this needs to be proven with morphological and genetic
    data rather than just echolocation data; a new valid name would also need to be
    described for the indorouxii taxon since the paper that first used indorouxii
    did not include a full description, holotype, and type locality designation https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004735/

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Styloctenium mindorensis
  replace: Styloctenium mindorense
  reason: recently described; specific epithet is usually spelt 'mindorensis', but

    spelling is 'mindorense' https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004511/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Tadarida aegyptiaca
  replace: Nyctinomus aegyptiacus
  reason: tentatively moved from Tadarida to Nyctinomus, but a more thorough revision

    thomasi may represent a distinct species, but is retained under T. aegyptiaca
    here https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005261/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Tomopeas ravus
  replace: Tomopeas ravum
