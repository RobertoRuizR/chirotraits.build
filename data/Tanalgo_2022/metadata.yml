  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Eptesicus serotinus
  replace: Cnephaeus serotinus
  reason: previously included E. pachyomus and E. isabellinus; may include E. kobayashii,
    but the species is tentatively retained here; the species also includes the recently
    described lobatus, which was described for populations from Ukraine to the Caucasus;
    these populations likely represent either the taxon turcomanus or mirza, which
    may be distinct species in their own right (either two distinct species, or a
    single species including both names); the taxonomic status of the eastern portion
    of the distribution of E. serotinus has yet to be determined; moved from Eptesicus
    to Cnephaeus https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005531/

  reason: Mispelling https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004606/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Hipposideros khasiana
  replace: Hipposideros larvatus
  reason: previously included H. poutensis and includes the recently described khasiana,
    which is a nomen nudum as the publication in which the name was first used does
    not include a proper description, holotype designation, or type locality; the
    khasiana form likely represents a distinct species, but further studies are needed
    to both confirm this and name the form; the species limits between H. grandis,
    H. larvatus, and H. poutensis is currently unresolved and represents a species
    complex https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004613/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Hipposideros pratti
  replace: Hipposideros swinhoii
  reason: previously known under the name H. pratti, but the name swinhoii was shown
    to be the appropriate name for the species; the name swinhoii was previously considered
    a synonym of H. armiger; often spelt 'swinhoei', but the name was originally spelt
    'swinhoii' and 'swinhoei' is an unjustified emendation (not appearing to be in
    prevailing use), so the spelling has been changed to match the original description
    https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004637/
  taxonomic_resolution: species

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Lophostoma silvicolum
  replace: Lophostoma silvicola
  reason: previously included L. occidentale; specific epithet has variously been
    spelt 'silvicola' and 'silvicolum', but 'silvicola' is the correct spelling as
    it the original spelling and is a noun in apposition https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004978/

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Myotis aurascens
  replace: Myotis davidii
  reason: includes aurascens and hajastanicus and has been considered to included
    M. nipalensis, but this species was recently recognized as distinct; aurascens
    and davidii are tentatively considered synonyms here, although some recent authors
    have suggested that this arrangement is premature; given the the uncertainty surrounding
    the taxonomy of this group, aurascens and davidii are still considered conspecific
    here following the trends in recent literature, although further research is certainly
    needed https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005396/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Myotis badius

  reason: includes peninsularis https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005481/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Natalus espiritosantensis
  replace: Natalus macrourus
  reason: split from N. stramineus (as espiritosantensis); then name macrourus has
    been shown to be the oldest name available for this species rather than espiritosantensis
    https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005275/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Notopteris macdonaldi
  replace: Notopteris macdonaldii
  reason: Synonym of Notopteris macdonaldii https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004412/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Notopteris neocaledonica
  replace: Notopteris neocaledonicus
  reason: has been spelt 'neocaledonica', but the genus Notopteris is considered masculine
    following Article 30.1.4.5 of the code, and 'neocaledonicus' is used here https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004413/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Paratriaenops furculus
  replace: Paratriaenops furcula
  reason: generally spelt furculus, but the name has been changed to furcula because
    it is a noun in apposition and does not change with generic gender; moved from
    Triaenops to Paratriaenops; moved from Hipposideridae to Rhinonycteridae https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004763/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Penthetor lucasi
  replace: Penthetor lucasii
  reason: often spelt with only one 'i', but the original description has two, which
    is what is used here https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004370/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Pipistrellus aladdin
  replace: Pipistrellus pipistrellus
  reason: Synonym of Pipistrellus pipistrellus https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005632/

  reason: includes the recently described huananus https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004743/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Rhinolophus indorouxii
  replace: Rhinolophus rouxii
  reason: includes the recently described indorouxii; indorouxii likely represents
    a distinct species, although this needs to be proven with morphological and genetic
    data rather than just echolocation data; a new valid name would also need to be
    described for the indorouxii taxon since the paper that first used indorouxii
    did not include a full description, holotype, and type locality designation https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004735/
  taxonomic_resolution: species

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Tadarida aegyptiaca
  replace: Nyctinomus aegyptiacus
  reason: tentatively moved from Tadarida to Nyctinomus, but a more thorough revision
    of Tadarida is needed as the genus as currently defined is polyphyletic; the name
    thomasi may represent a distinct species, but is retained under T. aegyptiaca
    here https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005261/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Tomopeas ravus
  replace: Tomopeas ravum
  reason: specific epithet generally spelt 'ravus', but the genus is considered neuter
    in gender, so the spelling is changed to 'ravum' here https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005269/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Triaenops rufus
  replace: Triaenops persicus
  reason: previously included T. afer and includes the names rufus and humbloti (populations

    to Rhinonycteridae https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004769/
  taxonomic_resolution: species

  replace: Tylonycteris pygmaea
