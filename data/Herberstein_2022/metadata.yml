taxonomic_updates:
- find: Chaerophon Ieucostigma
  replace: Mops leucostigma
  reason: Synonym of Mops leucostigma; https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005213/
  taxonomic_resolution: .na.character
- find: Chaerophon limbatus
  replace: Mops limbatus
  reason: Synonym of Mops pumilus; moved from Chaerephon to Mops, although further
    research is needed to confirm this placement https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005163/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Cynopterus horsfieldi
  replace: Cynopterus horsfieldii
  reason: Synonym of Cynopterus horsfieldii https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004375/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Diaemus rotundus
  replace: Desmodus rotundus
  reason: misspelled in Herberstein_2022, original publication (10.1139/z70-075) has data assigned as Desmodus rotundus
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Diaemus youngi
  replace: Diaemus youngii
  reason: spelling changed from 'youngi' to 'youngii' to match the original spelling
    for the name; https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004881/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Eonycteris spelea
  replace: Eonycteris spelaea
  reason: Mispelling https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004515/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Miniopterus gigas
  replace: Macroderma gigas
  reason: misspelled in Herberstein_2022, original publication (10.1007/s003600000121) has data assigned as Macroderma gigas
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Mimon crenulatum
  replace: Gardnerycteris keenani
  reason: split from G. crenulata; moved from Mimon to Gardnerycteris https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004970/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Miniopterus schreibers
  replace: Miniopterus schreibersii
  reason: Mispelling https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005135/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Molossus ate
  replace: Molossus nigricans
  reason: Mispelling of M. ater, synonym of Molossus nigricans https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005203/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Molossus major
  replace: Molossus molossus
  reason: Synonym of Molossus molossus https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005202/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Mops limbatus
  replace: Mops pumilus
  reason: previously included C. pusillus; moved from Chaerephon to Mops, although
    further research is needed to confirm this placement https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005159/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Myotis bechsteini
  replace: Myotis bechsteinii
  reason: Typo
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Myotis bocagei
  replace: Myotis bocagii
  reason: Typo
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Myotis daubentoni
  replace: Myotis daubentonii
  reason: Typo
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Pteropus edwarsi
  replace: Pteropus medius
  reason: the name medius is used instead of giganteus because giganteus is now considered
    a synonym of P. vampyrum; P. intermedius has been included under this species
    or under P. vampyrus, but the species is tentatively recognized here until further
    research is done https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004476/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Pteropus giganteus
  replace: Pteropus vampyrus
  reason: Synonym of Pteropus vampyrus https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004507/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Pteropus vampyru
  replace: Pteropus vampyrus
  reason: Typo
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Scotophilus gigas
  replace: Scotophilus nigrita
  reason: Synonym of Scotophilus nigrita https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005691/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Tadarida albiventer
  replace: Mormopterus jugularis
  reason: Synonym of Mormopterus jugularis https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005227/ also referenced in https://doi.org/10.5252/z2012n4a5
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Vampyrops helleri
  replace: Platyrrhinus helleri
  reason: Taxonomic update
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Vespertilio serotinus
  replace: Cnephaeus serotinus
  reason: previously included E. pachyomus and E. isabellinus; may include E. kobayashii,
    but the species is tentatively retained here; the species also includes the recently
    described lobatus, which was described for populations from Ukraine to the Caucasus;
    these populations likely represent either the taxon turcomanus or mirza, which
    may be distinct species in their own right (either two distinct species, or a
    single species including both names); the taxonomic status of the eastern portion
    of the distribution of E. serotinus has yet to be determined; moved from Eptesicus
    to Cnephaeus https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005531/
