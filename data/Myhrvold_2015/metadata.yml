    but the species is tentatively retained here; the species also includes the recently
    described lobatus, which was described for populations from Ukraine to the Caucasus;
    these populations likely represent either the taxon turcomanus or mirza, which
    may be distinct species in their own right (either two distinct species, or a
    single species including both names); the taxonomic status of the eastern portion
    of the distribution of E. serotinus has yet to be determined; moved from Eptesicus

- find: Hipposideros pratti
  replace: Hipposideros swinhoii
  reason: previously known under the name H. pratti, but the name swinhoii was shown
    to be the appropriate name for the species; the name swinhoii was previously considered
    a synonym of H. armiger; often spelt 'swinhoei', but the name was originally spelt
    'swinhoii' and 'swinhoei' is an unjustified emendation (not appearing to be in
    prevailing use), so the spelling has been changed to match the original description
