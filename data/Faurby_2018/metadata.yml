  replace: Cnephaeus serotinus
  reason: previously included E. pachyomus and E. isabellinus; may include E. kobayashii,
    but the species is tentatively retained here; the species also includes the recently
    described lobatus, which was described for populations from Ukraine to the Caucasus;
    these populations likely represent either the taxon turcomanus or mirza, which
    may be distinct species in their own right (either two distinct species, or a
    single species including both names); the taxonomic status of the eastern portion
    of the distribution of E. serotinus has yet to be determined; moved from Eptesicus

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Lophostoma silvicolum
  replace: Lophostoma silvicola
  reason: previously included L. occidentale; specific epithet has variously been
    spelt 'silvicola' and 'silvicolum', but 'silvicola' is the correct spelling as
    it the original spelling and is a noun in apposition https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004978/

  reason: includes annamiticus based on low molecular divergence https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005426/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Myotis aurascens
  replace: Myotis davidii
  reason: includes aurascens and hajastanicus and has been considered to included
    M. nipalensis, but this species was recently recognized as distinct; aurascens
    and davidii are tentatively considered synonyms here, although some recent authors
    have suggested that this arrangement is premature; given the the uncertainty surrounding
    the taxonomy of this group, aurascens and davidii are still considered conspecific
    here following the trends in recent literature, although further research is certainly
    needed https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005396/

  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Rousettus celebensis
  replace: Pilonycteris celebensis
  reason: moved from Rousettus to the recently described Pilonycteris https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004541/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Rousettus lanosus
  replace: Stenonycteris lanosa
  reason: moved from Rousettus to Stenonycteris https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004553/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Scotonycteris ophiodon
  replace: Casinycteris ophiodon
  reason: moved from Scotonycteris to Casinycteris https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004549/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Styloctenium mindorensis
  replace: Styloctenium mindorense
  reason: recently described; specific epithet is usually spelt 'mindorensis', but
    the name is an adjective and must match the generic gender, in which case the
    spelling is 'mindorense' https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004511/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Tadarida aegyptiaca
  replace: Nyctinomus aegyptiacus
  reason: tentatively moved from Tadarida to Nyctinomus, but a more thorough revision
    of Tadarida is needed as the genus as currently defined is polyphyletic; the name
    thomasi may represent a distinct species, but is retained under T. aegyptiaca
    here https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005261/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Tomopeas ravus
  replace: Tomopeas ravum
  reason: specific epithet generally spelt 'ravus', but the genus is considered neuter
    in gender, so the spelling is changed to 'ravum' here https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1005269/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Triaenops rufus
  replace: Triaenops persicus
  reason: previously included T. afer and includes the names rufus and humbloti (populations
    of which are now known under the replacement name T. menamena); moved from Hipposideridae
    to Rhinonycteridae https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxon/1004769/
  taxonomic_resolution: species
- find: Vampyriscus nymphaea
  replace: Vampyriscus nymphaeus
  reason: the specific epithet 'nymphaea/us' is treated as an adjective based on the
    Greek root rather than a Latin noun here; moved from Vampyressa to Vampyriscus
